# dots

This repository holds my dotfiles (see stow folder).

To install:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsedan/dots/HEAD/misc/install.sh)"
```

To update (optionally also updates all system packages):
```shell
up
```

To uninstall/unstow:
```shell
sh ~/dots/misc/uninstall.sh
```
Keep in mind uninstalling won't remove dependencies.
