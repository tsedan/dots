# dots

This repo holds my dotfiles. They are meant to be as minimal as possible.

These dotfiles have the particular restriction that their dependencies must be available under the same name on at least Mac (Homebrew) and Ubuntu (apt).

To install:
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsedan/dots/main/misc/install.sh)"
```

Afterwards, you can just run `up` in kitty to update your whole system, including the dotfiles.
