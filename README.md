# dots

This repo holds my dotfiles, which are built to work on most *NIX type systems.
They are meant to be as minimal as possible.

They have the particular requirement that all packages must be available for both Mac (Homebrew) and Ubuntu (apt). I also sometimes test them on Fedora.

To install:
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsedan/dots/main/misc/install.sh)"
```

Afterwards, you can just run `up` in kitty to update.
